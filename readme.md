# **MetaBridge**

<br>

## **Description**

MetaBridge is a [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)-based data integration
system for integration of metabolomics data with other omics types, chiefly
transcriptomics and proteomics.

## **Usage**

MetaBridge is designed to facilitate integrative analysis by identifying the
enzymes that directly interact with metabolites of interest, yielding genes
which may then be integrated with results from other omics methods. A pipeline
may be designed as such:

## **Tutorial**

workflow, please read our [tutorial](./tutorial/tutorial.md).
